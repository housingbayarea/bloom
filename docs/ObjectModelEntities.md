# Entities in the Bloom object model.

This is a (work-in-progress) list of the main entities in the Bloom object model.

## Property

A location where housing is available.

## PropertyGroup

A group of properties with common governance and/or oversight. A PropertyGroup could represent a city, county, property mangement company, or housing developer. Any given property may be part of one or more PropertyGroups (e.g. one for the city and one for the county).

_Future: it may be desireable to have PropertyGroups nestable for things like permissions in the future, but we're planning a flat structure for the foreseeable future._

## Unit

A part of a Property, where one houshold lives.

## Listing

A housing opportunity that can be applied for by applicants. A listing will be for no more than one Property, but may represent one or more units.
