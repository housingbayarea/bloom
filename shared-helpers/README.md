# Bloom Shared Helpers

This package is the home of types and functions intended for shared use between the Next.js sites within the Bloom monorepo. In certain instances there is also some commonality between the frontend plus the backend (not implemented currently).

## CLI

To run the test suite which is built with Jest run:

```
yarn test

# or

yarn test:coverage # generates local coverage reports, useful as you are writing tests
```
