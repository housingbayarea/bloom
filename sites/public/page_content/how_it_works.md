1. ## Find Apartments Accepting Applications (Listings)

  <p class="markdown__lead">Find high-quality, affordable rental housing opportunities located throughout Alameda County on the listing page of this Housing Portal.</p>

  The simplest way to find opportunities that are accepting applications is to visit the affordable housing portal within the area you wish to live.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about how to find listings" openLabel="Read less about how to find listings">

  Another way to find Affordable Housing is to search the list of [Additional Housing Opportunities and Resources](/additional-resources) available on the affordable housing portal.

  These housing opportunities and resources provide the names, locations, and contact information for affordable housing programs and properties. You may also check our sister site [AC Housing Choices](https://achousingchoices.org/) for a list of additional affordable apartment properties. However, property managers of apartments on those lists may not be able to accept applications because they already have a lot of applications that must be processed before they are able to  accept new applications. Start by identifying properties that meet your needs and then contact the associated properties to find out if those properties are accepting applications. For access to other programs, including housing authority Section 8 housing assistance, please reach out to the listed contacts on the [Additional Housing Opportunities and Resources](/additional-resources) page.

2. ## Check Eligibility

  <p class="markdown__lead">Determine if your household meets the requirements for the property.</p>

  Affordable housing is reserved for people with limited income and/or other special circumstances. Applicants will need to assess their ability to meet the population and income requirements at the property for which they choose to apply.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about checking your eligibility" openLabel="Read less about checking your eligibility">

  ### Population Requirements

  Most affordable housing properties are available to people with limited income. However, a small percentage is designated for specific populations as well. Examples include:

  * Seniors: These may include apartments designated as “senior” housing for individuals over a particular age.
  * People with developmental disabilities: All of the units in a property, or a percentage of units within a property, may be designated for people with disabilities.
  * Transition Age Youth (TAY): Transition Age Youth  are individuals between the ages of 16 and 24 years old who are in transition from state custody or foster care environments and are at-risk.
  * Special needs: Special needs covers various populations, including, but not limited to, households experiencing homelessness, or that are at risk of homelessness, as well as individuals with developmental disabilities. Homes in these particular communities typically include services or features that support the Special Needs population. 

  Be sure to read about the population requirements by going to the property’s listing on the affordable housing portal before contacting the property manager.

  ### Income Requirements

  Your total household income cannot exceed the maximum household income limits for the property, based on the following definitions:

  * Household: A “household” may be just one person, or two or more persons. All household members that will be living in the home must be included in the application. 
  * Household income: The combined annual income from all persons over 18 years old who are part of the household. 
  * Maximum household income: You will be asked to provide the “gross” Maximum Income (also known as Gross Household Income). This refers to the total income before taxes or other deductions. 
  * Minimum household income: The minimum monthly income required to be eligible for the property, typically equal to 1.5 or 2 times monthly rent.

  There are three ways to determine if your household meets the minimum and maximum income requirements. 

  #### 1\. View the Income Requirements for Properties listed on the Alameda County Housing Portal

  Properties that are listed on the Alameda County Housing  Portal will show the minimum and maximum household income requirements for applicants. Click on the link for the specific property listing in which you are interested. Scroll down to the tables which list the minimum and maximum income required for each apartment. 

  #### 2\. Contact the property manager

  If the property you are interested in is not listed on the Alameda County  Housing Portal, it is most likely not accepting applications at the present time. However, you may contact the property manager listed for that property to find out the eligibility requirements.

  #### 3\. Check the income tables published by the housing agency in your area

  You may also check the income tables published on the housing agency website in the area in which your desired affordable housing is located. These tables are produced by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and are updated annually. [Tables for Alameda County are provided here.](https://www.acgov.org/cda/hcd/hud-income-rent_limits.htm) A household would typically be considered eligible for most affordable housing if the household income is 60% of Area Median Income (AMI) or below.  However, some properties have rents that are restricted to “moderate” income households with incomes up to 120% of AMI. If you have questions regarding these tables, please contact the agency in the area for which you are looking for affordable housing.

  #### Preferences

  Some cities have adopted “preferences” that provide applicants who meet the preference criteria with a greater chance of being selected. A common example is a preference for applicants who live or work in the area in which the affordable housing site is located. Be sure to provide all the information requested on the application as it may allow you to qualify for any available preferences. 

  If you need help applying, go to the [Resources](/additional-resources) page.

3. ## Apply Online

  <p class="markdown__lead">You will be asked to complete a short application for a unit at that property.</p>

  Be sure to complete your application by the date specified on the property. Properties listed on the web portal require a minimum amount of information to be submitted on a “short-form” digital or paper application.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about applying online" openLabel="Read less about applying online">

  After you submit your application, you may be contacted by the property manager. If contacted, you will be asked to provide documentation on your income and finances. If you are not immediately selected for a placement interview, this doesn’t mean that you were not eligible to live at the property. A property manager may keep your application for several years before contacting you. Stay in touch with the property manager by periodically checking in regarding the status of your application.

  Due to the high demand for affordable housing, it can take a while before you get contacted for potential placement at a specific apartment. Therefore, it is important that you apply for housing at multiple properties that meet your housing needs and keep track of the properties that you have applied to. It is also important to complete Step 5 (Get Prepared for Placement ) even if you are not contacted right away by the property manager for placement in an apartment. Getting your finances in order, including reviewing your household budget, taking care of your credit, and gathering the required documents, will prepare you for when you are contacted by a property manager.

4. ## Get the results

  <p class="markdown__lead">You will be contacted by the property manager with further instructions.</p>

  The time between submitting your application and being contacted by the property manager  depends on the number of vacancies in the property. It may vary from a couple of weeks to months and in some cases can take up to several years. Some people will not be selected for the next step in the process because they do not qualify to live in the apartment due to their income or other reasons.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about getting results" openLabel="Read less about getting results">

  There are two methods that property managers use to determine the order in which applicants are selected to move forward in the application process. One method is to organize the applications by the date and time that the application was received (“first come, first serve”). The second method is to randomize the applications on a computer to generate an order for all applications. Randomization of the applications only takes place after the application due date. 

  If you receive a letter or email from the property manager notifying you that you are moving forward in the application process, you are one step closer to being selected for an apartment. You should keep a record of any documentation that you receive from property managers.

5. ## Get Prepared for Placement

  <p class="mt-4">If you are notified that you are moving forward in the application process, there will be two next steps: 1) submitting identification documents and financial information to the property manager; and 2) meeting with the property manager.</p>

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about preparing for next steps" openLabel="Read less about preparing for next steps">

  ### 1\. Submitting identification documents and financial information

  The property manager will ask for documents to verify the information provided in your application. Gathering this information before you are contacted by the property manager will help you prepare for selection as a tenant in an apartment.  

  The documents that a property manager may require are summarized below into two different categories: A) identification documents and B) financial information. The set of documents requested may vary, depending upon the property’s requirements for placement.

  #### A\. Identification Documents

  The documents listed below are not necessarily required, but they may help the property manager review your application.

  * Photo identification for everyone in your household who is 18 or older
  * Birth Certificate, or Social Security Card, or passport for everyone   under 18.

  #### B\. Financial Information

  * Income: You will be asked to provide all sources of income for each member of your household over 18 years of age. Examples include:
    * Welfare, Veteran benefits, social security letter  
    * Rental assistance voucher
    * Recent paystubs from your current employer
    * Self-Employment proof 
    * Alimony 
    * Current pension or retirement income
  
  
  * Expenses:
    * Checking account statements
    * Savings account statements
    * Most recent credit card statement
    * Alimony payments 
  
  
  * Other Financial Information:  
    * The last official statement of 401k or IRA 
    * Assets – i.e., vehicles, stocks or real estate 

  The property manager will review your credit as part of reviewing your financial information. There are many resources available online to help you understand and improve your credit score. One article is [How to Improve Your Credit Score: Tips & Tricks (debt.org)](https://www.debt.org/credit/improving-your-score/).

  As stated, **you do _not_ need to possess these documents to submit your initial application** via the Alameda County Housing Portal. However, gathering these documents will help you prepare you for the next step in the application process. If you do not possess these documents, you can get assistance from a housing counselor, who can help you obtain them. Contact the housing agency in your area to find out how to obtain housing counseling.

  ### 2\. Meeting with the Property Manager

  The placement interview is the last step in the application process. Depending on the property, the property manager may request a meeting with you before or after you have gathered the requested documents.  The property manager may request that all of your household members attend the meeting. The property manager will review your documents with you and determine whether or not you are qualified to live in the apartment.
