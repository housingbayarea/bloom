1. ## Find Apartments Accepting Applications (Listings)

  ### Find high-quality, affordable housing opportunities located throughout the Bay Area.

  The simplest way to find opportunities that are accepting applications is to visit the affordable housing portal within the area you wish to live.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about how to find listings" openLabel="Read less about how to find listings">

  Another way to find Affordable Housing is to search the list of “[more housing opportunities and resources](/additional-resources)” available on the affordable housing portal.

  These housing opportunities and resources provide the names, locations, and contact information for Affordable Housing programs and properties. Unfortunately, property managers of apartments on these lists are often not able to accept applications because they already have a lot of applications that must be processed before they can accept new applications. You should identify properties that meet your needs and contact the associated properties to find out if those properties are accepting applications. For access to other programs, including housing authority Section housing assistance, please reach out to the listed contacts.

* ## Check Eligibility

  ### Determine if your household meets the requirements for the property.

  Affordable housing is reserved for people with limited income and/or other special circumstances. Applicants will need to assess their ability to meet the population and income requirements at the property for which they choose to apply.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about checking your eligibility" openLabel="Read less about checking your eligibility">

  #### Population Requirements

  Most affordable housing properties are available to people with limited income. However, a small percentage is designated for specific populations as well. Examples include:

  * Seniors: These may include apartments designated as “senior” housing for individuals over a particular age (such as 55, 62, or 70). 
  * People with Developmental Disabilities: Whole communities, or a percentage of units within a property, may be designated for people with disabilities. 
  * Transition Age Youth (TAY): Transition Age Youth is defined as individuals between the ages of 16 and 24 years old who are in transition from state custody or foster care environments and are at-risk.
  * Special Needs: Special Needs is a definition that covers various populations, including, but not limited to households experiencing homelessness or that are at risk of homelessness as well as individuals with developmental disabilities. Homes in these particular communities typically include services or features that support the Special Needs population. 

  Be sure to read about the population requirements by going to the property website before contacting the property manager. 

  #### Income Requirements

  Your total household income cannot exceed the maximum household income limits for the property.

  * Household: A “household” can be just one person or two or more persons. All household members that will be living in the home must be included in the application. 
  * “Household income”: This means the combined annual income from all persons over 18 years old who are part of the household. 
  * Maximum Household income: You will be asked to provide the “Gross” Maximum Income (also known as Gross Household Income). This refers to the total income before taxes or other deductions. 
  * Some affordable homes also have minimum income requirements.

  There are three ways to determine if your household meets the minimum and maximum income requirements. These are summarized below.

  ##### 1\. View the Income Requirements for Properties listed on the Doorway website

  Properties that are listed on the Doorway Web Portal will show the minimum and maximum household incomes required for applicants. Click on the link for the specific property listing in which you are interested. Scroll down to the tables which list the minimum and maximum income required for each apartment. 

  ##### 2\. Contact the property manager

  If the property you are interested in is not listed on the Doorway web portal, it is most likely not accepting applications at the present time. However, you may contact the property manager listed for that property to find out the eligibility requirements for that site.

  ##### 3\. Check the income tables published by the housing agency in your area

  You can also check the income tables published on the housing agency website in the area in which your desired affordable housing is located. These tables are produced by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and are updated annually. Tables for Alameda County are provided here. A household would typically be considered as eligible for most affordable housing if the household income is 60% of Area Median Income (AMI) or below.  However, some properties have rents that are restricted to “moderate” income households with incomes up to 120% of AMI. If you have questions regarding these tables, please contact the agency in the area for which you are looking for affordable housing.

  ##### Preferences

  Some cities have adopted “preferences” that provide applicants with a greater chance of being selected. A common example of a preference is a preference for applicants that live or work in the area in which the specific affordable housing site is located. Be sure to provide all the information requested on the application as it may allow you to qualify for any available preferences. 

  If you need help applying, go to the “[Resources](/additional-resources)” page.

* ## Apply Online

  ### You will be asked to complete a short application for a unit at that property.

  Be sure to complete your application by the date specified on the property. Properties listed on the web portal require a minimum amount of information to be submitted on a “short-form” digital or paper application.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about applying online" openLabel="Read less about applying online">

  After you submit your application, you may be contacted by the property manager. If contacted, you will be asked to provide documentation on your income and finances. If you are not immediately selected for a placement interview, this doesn’t mean that you were not eligible to live at the property. A property manager may keep your application for several years before contacting you. Stay in touch with the property manager by periodically checking in regarding the status of your application.

  Due to the high demand for affordable housing, it can take a while before you get contacted for potential placement at a specific apartment. Therefore, it is important that you apply for housing at multiple properties that meet your housing needs and keep track of the properties that you have applied to. It is also important to complete Step 5 (Prepare for Next Steps) even if you are not placed in an apartment. Getting your finances in order, including reviewing your household budget, taking care of your credit, and gathering the required documents, will prepare you for when you are contacted by a property manager.

* ## Get the results

  ### Once ranking order is ready, results will be posted for you to download.

  Depending on the property, the property manager will confirm that they have received your application by emailing or mailing letters to applicants. Some properties do not provide you with a notification that the property manager has received your application.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about getting results" openLabel="Read less about getting results">

  There are two different methods that property managers use to determine the order in which applicants are selected to move forward in the application process. One method is to organize the applications by the date and time that the application was received (“first come, first serve”). The second method is to randomize the applications on a computer to generate an order for all applications. Randomization of the applications only takes place after the application due date. 

  If you receive a letter or email from the property manager notifying you that you are moving forward in the application process, this means that you are one step closer to being selected for an apartment. You should keep a record of any documentation that you receive from property managers.

* ## Prepare for Next Steps

  ### You may be contacted by the property manager notifying you that you are moving forward.

  Once contacted by the property manager, there are several things you can do to prepare for the next steps. These include getting your finances and financial documents in order and gathering the required personal documents.

  <SubSection closedLabel="Read more about preparing for next steps" openLabel="Read less about preparing for next steps">

  #### Finances

  There are three main ways to improve your financial position so that you can readily qualify for affordable housing. Those three ways include: a) preparing a budget, b) taking care of your credit, and c) gathering the required documents.

  ##### Reviewing Household Budget

  By definition, residents of affordable housing are typically expected to pay no more than 30% of their gross income on rent. Reviewing your budget to determine how much money you will have for housing, after deducting other monthly expenses, will help you determine the affordable housing sites for which you will qualify.

  ##### Taking care of your credit

  Property managers may or may not take an applicant’s credit score into consideration when selecting applicants for rental housing. For this reason, it is important to establish and maintain good credit. Credit card balances, and late or missed payments all have an impact on your credit score. 
  
  There are many resources available online to help you understand and improve your credit score.

  ##### Gathering the Required Documents

  At some point in the application process, you will be required to submit financial and personal documents to verify the information provided in your application. It is best to start gathering this information before you submit an application for housing.

  [Read more about gathering documents](#)

  The documentation that is potentially required is listed below - please note that property managers will not ask for all the documents listed below, these are just examples of the types of documents that may be asked for. It is summarized into two different sections: 1) financial documents and 2) personal documents. Make sure you keep these documents on file so that you are not strapped for time if you get called in for an interview.
  
  ##### Financial Documents:

  Some examples of financial documents that property managers may ask for at the time of your interview include: employment or income information (work paystubs, social security letter, checking/savings account statements, alimony/child support letters), tax statements (W-2 forms, tax returns), public benefits (rental assistance voucher, veterans benefits), liabilities (credit card statements) and assets (401k/IRA statements) 

  ##### Personal Documents:

  Some examples of personal documents include the following forms of identification: Driver’s license/state ID, birth certificate, social security, and passport. 

  If you do not have or do not know how to obtain these documents, you can get assistance from a housing counselor, who can help you gather your documents.
