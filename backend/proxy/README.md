### Rationale

We want to serve different versions of the API under different paths e.g. `/v2`, `/v3` but not necessarily reflect that convention in the code.
To achieve that an NGINX proxy has been created and set up as an entrypoint to the entire API. It provides path level routing e.g. `/v2` will be routed to a different heroku APP then `/`.

### Running Locally with Docker Desktop

# make sure Docker Desktop is started

# build the image: `docker build --pull --rm -f "backend/proxy/Dockerfile" -t bloom:latest "backend/proxy"`

# In the Docker Desktop Dashboard, go to "Images", find the image and click "Run" (play button)

# Configure Optional Settings before running:

# Ports -> Host Port: 9000

# Environment Variables:

    - PORT: 80
    - BACKEND_HOSTNAME: [Your local IP]:3100 (e.g. 192.168.86.231:3100)
    - PROTOCOL: http
    - ALLOW_LIST: localhost:3000|localhost:3001

# Run and you should be able to access listings at http://localhost:9000/listings

### Setup

Based on [this tutorial](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/bloom-reference-backend-proxy/deploy/heroku-container). All values are for `bloom-reference-backend-proxy` and each environment requires it's own proxy.

#### Install the Heroku CLI

Download and install the Heroku CLI.

If you haven't already, log in to your Heroku account and follow the prompts to create a new SSH public key.

```
$ heroku login
```

#### Log in to Container Registry

You must have Docker set up locally to continue. You should see output when you run this command.

```
$ docker ps
```

Now you can sign into Container Registry.

```
$ heroku container:login
```

_Note_ if you are using an Apple M1 device the following steps will not work. You will have to do the following: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67001433

Push your Docker-based app
Build the Dockerfile in the current directory and push the Docker image.

```
# workdir: backend/proxy
$ heroku container:push --app bloom-reference-backend-proxy web
```

Deploy the changes
Release the newly pushed images to deploy your app.

```
$ heroku container:release --app bloom-reference-backend-proxy web
```

#### Configuration

Heroku Proxy app requires four environment variables to work:

PORT: 443
BACKEND_HOSTNAME: bloom-backend-orm.herokuapp.com
PROTOCOL: https
ALLOW_LIST: partners.bloom.exygy.dev|bloom.exygy.dev
